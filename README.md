# UAFRMC/2018
Aurora Robotics is The University of Alaska, Fiarbanks' team in the annual [NASA Robotic Mining Competition](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html). This repository is our 2018 control stack.

###What is different from 2017 ?
2018 is our first year using [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). We decided to use ROS since [Ryker Dial](https://github.com/rykerDial) has worked on a navigation and autonomy stack based on ROS for his master's thesis.
