For blinky detection, I need to do one A/D conversion every millisecond, with good synchronization.  This means timing is important.


Call send_motors repeatedly: 20ms(!)
Call send_motors every 25ms: 240us (tx buffer has room => fast!)
Call read_packet and handle_packet: 760us
Call micros(): 12us
One analogRead: 100us(!)

Adding a low latency probe in read_packet loop: no change
Adding probes in handle_packet (around read_sensors): to 580us
Adding probes between every 2 analogReads in read_sensors: 230us
Adding probes between every analogRead in read_sensors: 140us



I'm going to get bad latency if I don't limit my serial bandwidth use.
	57600 baud -> 5KB/sec, about 5 bytes/ms
	1 10-bit sample / ms
	3 10-bit samples -> one 4-byte payload -> one 6-byte A_packet
	6 samples -> 8 byte payload -> one 10-byte A-packet every 6ms (fine)
